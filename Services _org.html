        <h3>Analyze</h3>
        <p>To start thinking about some essentials part of an interior design company is a crucial step.
          Which means we are not only simply design a website, but also design for interior design content and services.
          Thus, to demonstrate what kind of service that company can offer, we have to design a service list with clear
          hierarchy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Evaluate</h3>
        <p>Thinking about the service list is not hard. But design a clear hierarchy for services could take time to think about it.
          Our group spent some time on other interior design companies' websites. We find out the solution to design a service list with a clear hierarchy. 
          That is to state different areas with different services and then use some elements like cards to define a level of services.

      <h2>IAT235 A01 INFORMATION DESIGN MOCKUP</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Describe</h3>
        <p>This is a website information mock up design for City of Vancouver: Vancouver plan.  </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Analyze</h3>
        <p>From my design perspective, a series of data can express a lot of information from one thing. But, what does the audience sees should be visualized.
           By contrast, a visualized chart represents data information clearly than a single one data represented.
            Thus, audiences understand the information of the data as clear as the chart presented.
            Consequently, make data to represent information is a crucial step in the design. Also, the color of the chart can represent different information, 
            which means using different colors to categorized different data is important in design steps.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Evaluate</h3>
        <p>I decided to use a visualized chart inside the Vancouver plan website. 
          The reason why did I chose a webpage to deliver information, because this webpage will be inside the Vancouver plan website, 
          and when a viewer clicks the webpage to receive information the can clearly know about the out-migration of Vancouver city, 
          thus it's unnecessary to reach every single data website to find out data.
